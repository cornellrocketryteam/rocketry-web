Javelina's systems were nearly all Student Researched and Developed (SRAD), from its avionic electronics and software to its motor casing and grains. This was our second rocket to compete in the 10,000 ft SRAD solid motor category, and we are proud to say we had a successful flight with all SRAD systems working as expected!"

Our first ever rocket with a student researched and developed (SRAD) motor, Ursa Major successfully launched and achieved a 10,115 ft apogee out of the predicted 10,201 ft, earning an excellent flight score on the first day of launches. Both parachutes were also successfully deployed at the correct altitudes, and the rocket was recovered with no damage! Cornell Rocketry took home first place in the 10K Solid SRAD category, and was awarded second place overall out of all competing teams!"

After multiple 3am starts and rain delays, Cornell Rocketry was the 5th team out of 100 teams to launch their rocket. Big Red 1 lifted off the pad on the 3rd ignition attempt and soared to 10367 feet. On the way down, the main parachute deployed prematurely due to hard accelerations caused by a delayed drogue parachute deployment. Even with this failure, the rocket was still smoothly recovered without damage. Cornell Rocketry placed 5th in 10K COTS and 10th overall."
