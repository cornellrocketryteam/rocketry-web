      "description": "Andromeda was CRT’s competition rocket for the 2025 Spaceport America Cup. This was our first ever student research and designed (SRAD) hybrid rocket. From the avionics bay to the guided descent system to the fluid system, every component was SRAD. Three years of research and development culminated in a rocket that reached 12,100 ft on test flight, powered by 1,385 lbf of thrust from its hybrid motor. With Andromeda, Cornell Rocketry proudly took home 3rd place in the 10K Hybrid SRAD category!"

Both parachutes were also successfully deployed at the correct altitudes, and the rocket was recovered with no damage! Cornell Rocketry took home first place in the 10K Solid SRAD category, and was awarded second place overall out of all competing teams!"

Big Red 1 lifted off the pad on the 3rd ignition attempt and soared to 10367 feet. On the way down, the main parachute deployed prematurely due to hard accelerations caused by a delayed drogue parachute deployment. Even with this failure, the rocket was still smoothly recovered without damage. Cornell Rocketry placed 5th in 10K COTS and 10th overall."

It utilizes a Cesaroni K740 motor and achieves a liftoff thrust of 191.1 lbs and a rail exit velocity of 70.1 ft/s. On board, it houses the Payload Enclosure Mechanism (PEM) for securing the payload through flight, and holds an avionics bay packed with a multitude of tracking electronics and radios for sending telemetry back to the ground station. On Space Jam's most recent flight, it reached an altitude of 5,277 feet, just 3 feet shy of the target apogee of 1 mile!"
